Demo: not set up yet

To do:
- option to have the script stop when all strings have been reached once or a certain number of transitions occured
- option to set a specific start and/or specific end string and let the rest be random
- don't change string size in addition to changing a letter at the same time
- don't change a letter with each tick, if there are fewer existing letters to be replaced than added/substracted
